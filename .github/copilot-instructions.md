# General Behavior Rules
- Befor you do bigger changes (anything above 3 lines of code) shortly outline your plan in concise bullet points and ask for confirmation
- Only do what I specifcally aks for. No extras. You still can suggest extras if you really think they would be a good idea.
- Don't do too much at once. Break things up and ask me for confirmation inbetween, so I can follow what's happening


# Project specific
- There is a subject.txt in the root of this repo which specifies how the project should work when it is finished. Use it as a general guidance.
